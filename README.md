# hello-world
My first ever repository here on github. 
Hello, my name is Sanyiah (san-ya). I go by San, or just Sanyiah. 
I'm currently on my first year of my Computer Science degree.
so far, most concepts I've been learning in this program are new to me, but I find these concepts fascinating.
here's to more fruitful years. 
Thanks for reading!
